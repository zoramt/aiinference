This example uses Pytorch to train the flower classifier using the Iris dataset. The trained model is converted to ONNX and logged to the AI Registry. The ONNX model is then deployed to Cloudera AI Inference. Once the model endpoint is available, you can run the batch inference example. Remember to customize the [./infer_iris.py](infer_iris.py) script to the correct BASE_URL, and MODEL_NAME. You might also need to modify the `load_token()` function to obtain the auth token from elsewhere, say as a project environment variable.
